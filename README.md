## Project Name: Serverless To-Do List on AWS

### Project Description:

In this project, I will build a serverless web application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3. The application will allow users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) items from a DynamoDB table.

## Live Demo

### Project Architecture:

![Serverless Web Application on AWS Architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66474973/228492073-5cd3d975-3439-4ce4-b109-fb33997df3c3.png)

- **S3**: Used to host the static website.
- **CloudFront**: CDN for faster content delivery.
- **Route 53**: DNS service for routing traffic to the website.
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for storing view count.
- **Lambda**: Serverless compute service used for the backend logic.

### Steps to Build the Project:

* Create a DynamoDB table to store the items. \
* Build a Lambda function to handle the CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table. \
* Use S3 to store and host the web application's static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). \
* Create a CloudFront distribution to serve the S3-hosted static files with low latency. \

### Expected Outcome:

Upon completing the project, I will have a working serverless web application hosted on AWS. I will gain hands-on experience building a serverless application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, and CloudFront. Additionally, I will have experience working with AWS services and integrating them to build a complete solution.

This project will help me improve my skills in cloud computing, serverless architecture, and AWS services.
